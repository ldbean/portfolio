                All my life, I've been told to do things a certain way by those I look up to in order to "be successful". Here's the thing, every one of those people have had something completely different to suggest for me to do. Well I know myself, and I know that choosing one option over all the other, equally delicious ones doesn't work for me. I like to do a lot of things, and I am not going to limit myself to just one. Sure that may make it difficult for someone like you, reader, who may be interested in a certain type of person to hire for your project, to filter through all the weird work I have on my portfolio in front of you today, but I like to think you've at least enjoyed your time here a little bit. And that sounds successful to me.

                At the end of the day, I am an artist. And as an artist, my goal is always to do whatever it takes to bring a vision to life. I love the challenge of making something out of nothing - of developing ideas and seeing them through to fruition, with all the problem solving and learning on the fly included (my favorite parts). My skill tree is widespread and always growing, not only because technologies are always evolving, but because I simply love to learn and create. Sometimes that means I jump from medium to medium.

                TLDR; both art and tech have been big parts of my life, so my skills and interests mostly span across the two fields. Because of this, I have picked up various disciplines over the years. Digital and traditional painting and illustration, graphic, web, and motion design, 3D game/realtime and VFX modeling, texturing, and animation, web development(I created this website with React), and even hardware and software support and repair for computers and cell phones (although that leans more towards personal interests, but has come in handy professionally).

                If you are interested in working with me on any type of project, I would be more than happy to discuss this with you over email. Currently I my goals and interests align with Technical and Environment art for games. I hope my recent projects reflect that.
